# Coinmin

A few days ago, I came across a project I really liked the look of: [coinmon](https://github.com/bichenkk/coinmon.git).

I thought it was pretty neat, but as I looked into the code I was surprised by how many dependencies it had! Reminded me a bit of leftpad... Anyway I figured maybe some people (oddballs like me), might appreciate a CLI tool that's effectively a few lines of bash but does the same thing, without 20 odd npm dependencies. Big love to coinmon though, check it out I think they're working on new features.
